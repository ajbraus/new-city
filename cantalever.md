The ingot could be considered the currency, the raw material, the substrate that Marcus worked on directly to press, rend and finally weld into his mesmerizing contraptions.
Two weeks before, a lori brought a crate of steel ingots Marcus had requested from his supplier in Norest — New Sydney’s smithies’ district.
Marcus clutched the box of ingots greedily to his chest, feeling his back pop dangerously as he heaved himself, ingots up to earlobes, into the elevator. The trip up 46 flights gave him the chance to steady the box that quivered dangerously on the lip of the filligree pattern on the inside of the elevator, rip a corner of the box open, and finger inside to feel  the cool utter smoothness of their hyper-tense membranes.
The ingots were bloody awesome.
In general, Marcus thought, things that were done poorly, were done “really shit” but things that were done well were done “bloody awesome.”
Marcus appreciated the world uniformly into these two narrow categories, things were either “really shit” or “bloody awesome.” It made the world simple. The simplicity left his mind free and open like a large oak table upon which a diplomat can one day scatter all his papers of the affairs of state of many countries, the next day surround it with the heads and ministers of state, and the next hold a war council. For Marcus, however, his table he filled with the mechanical fittings of his art. His binary way of seeing the world gave him such a feeling of pleasure and such an advantage spiritually and artistically it never occurred to Marcus consciously that this dichotomy was the outward sign of a mental simpleton.
His contact in Norest, Kell, had been trolling the web and when he came across the plans for a malleable, chrome-finish steel. He immediately thought of his friend Marcus, and when Kell contacted his old friend, Marcus ordered a standard batch.






The cataclysm had forced autarky on all cities, and the web now distributed the ways and means of each new advancement of process, operations, and science. It took fifty years for this new system to begin to rival the gross product of the system of global trade that characterized the organization of the human race on the globe a short half century before. Now, however, it was roughly equivalent, and although food still came dear, and many parts of the world suffered under political turmoil and corruption, nevertheless, the new system had some advantages over the old one.
