"Girls with big noses have big personalities — just look at Lucy!"

Patrick O'Henry (who went by 'Henry' to avoid confusion with his wife, Patricia) wasn't making his teen-age daughter Lily feel any better. Lucy, the O'Henry family's orange and white corgi looked around from face to face with eternal expectation.

Henry believed his advice would have a long term effect on his middle daughter. In his derangement, he thought quite consciously that when she was much older and could appreciate having a dad who told the truth, she would appreciate having learned so early on that it wasn't about having something that was positively good, it was having something that was not as shabby as all the others. That fact, he reasoned, would get her through some hard times.

Patrick went by the name Henry and had big bracer arms like a pirate's, thick and thickly matted with black hair. He could grapple his three daughters to the ground, even into their teens, in play fights on the floor of their two bedroom 12th floor apartment, in Hapsburo about a hundred kilometers from New Sydney.

The daughter's mother, Patricia Nicholas, didn't love her husband. In milder times, they might have avoided not seeing eye to eye, but they had known each other through trying difficulties, so trying that Patricia had had the opportunity to learn that he was a coward. In an effort to save her daughters from binding themselves to a coward as she had, she excoriated him often to his face and behind his hairy back.

"Don't worry about your looks,” Patricia lectured. “The only thing you have to worry about is what you contribute. Just look at your father, if he had lifted one finger, we would be fatter than a hen after Easter."

However directly she actually meant to spurn her husband, Henry always dodged their barb since he considered his wife's criticisms the height of educational material for his gaggle of daughters. He was like those inflated clowns or dinosaurs that always came back when you punch them down.

Patrick O'Henry's was known as Henry. Henry had large shoulders and a weak chest and back that made his natural posture a kind of caved over slouch, perfect for shirking work, and hugging his children.

Lily felt the ridge of her nose, felt its gargantuan, hideous proportions. In a propio-septive mind's eye, she saw the parts of her body she thought about most as huge and apparent to everyone. Her self-consciousness made her nubile breasts feel as though they were as big as loaves of bread. The flatness of her butt felt like when an observer looks over the edge of the viewing deck of a skyscaper. Uninteresting parts of the body, wrists, ankles, her small feet, warm skin, good teeth, evaneced under the shadow cast by that huge and sail-like schnoz.

"Why didn't you see this coming? can't they screen for this sort of thing?" Lily said.
"No, we weren't going to change anything about you," said her mother.
"What's not to like?" said Henry.
"Would you change anything about me?" the 8-year-old, Henrietta squeaked naively. She was fishing for attention while her pubesing sister squirmed and fidgeted with self-consciousness-inspired delusions.
Henry did not make light of his youngest daughters' concerns, even though he understood the selfish motivations behind many of them.
"There was a kind of mix up with you Etta," Henry said, his voice serious. He motioned for Henrietta to come closer to him. "We almost sent you back, but we thought, no we better keep her anyways, even if . . . "
"What was it?" she asked, totally dumbfounded.
“No, it was nothing, just forget it.”
“Tell me,” she said, now defiant.
"Well, it had to do with your ribs."
"My ribs?" She wrinkled her nose and lifted her hands up to the bottom of her ribcage.
"What they said, and believe me, I haven't double checked this so it could all be wrong, and I don't know how much I trusted these guys, so you understand if we settle this once and for all? Yes?" Henry leaned forward, intentionally or not, deeply mesmerizing his daughter into forgetting the problems of her older sister.
Etta's mouth hung open slightly and she nodded slowly with intense sincerity.
"They said," Henry continued, "that you had too few."
"Ribs?"
"And now, there is only one way to find out." With this Henry grabbed the girl by her strong little arm and pulled her in for a tickling rib-count.
"One...two...three...hold still...four" Henry said loudly over his daughter's squeals.

Patricia smiled. The oaf loved better than he did anything else, and he knew what was good for the people he loved. Patricia never gave him credit for these traits, and even at that moment, she was unconscious of how precious her doofus, looser husband was.
Now it was time for the eldest (about whom this story really pertains) to speak up about what they had all be avoiding discussing during dinner.
"Dad, can you help me with my bags." Helen said.
"I'll clean up the table with your help my dears," Patricia said to the Lily and Etta.





In thirty minutes the dishes were done, and Henry came out of Helen's room with her suitcase.
"Have you got everything? Don't forget a swimming suit." Patricia said. Helen's sister Lily winced even at the thought of a swimming suit.
"A swimming suit, seriously mom?" Helen said. "I think I have everything I need." Helen tapped on her phone and reached down to touch her bag, as if scanning its contents telepathically. She nodded.

The family took the bus to the radiant, green-glass train station about three kilometers from their house. That sultry evening countless people poured into and out of the gleaming building. From bedraggled workers in blue jump-suits—mainly Thai—to Chinese merchants carrying giant bags of electronics, the straps of their woven plastic bags across their forehead.

The family past a pack of Chinese traders in black suits, and like unique punctuation marks, they spotted micro-industrialists of all shapes, colors, and sizes, each one so particular—one an African with tortis shell glasses and a white jumpsuit, another a sharp-featured Swiss dictating into his tooth, still another with wispy long hair and a horse's face had crouched down, fastened on his Sight and Jammer and was feveriously tabulating the air before his face, no doubt working on the calculations of some program, enzyme, or work of art. There were a few asylum seekers, fresh off the boat, floating in the mix as well, and no doubt, Henry's conspiracy-theory prone mind reasoned darkly, a few spies.  

Sweat dripped off Henry as he carried Helen's bag across the train platform.

Gleaming blue, with a nose striped with tropical colors, like a parakeet's tail-feathers, the train stood waiting to take their daughter away. Patricia began to cry softly. Then, everyone started crying, except Henry. His large green eyes just tearing full.

Patricia took Helen by the shoulders and said, "Remember your father — getting an education is your first priority."

Helen hugged her sisters, and tickled Lily some more to chase away the tears, then turned to her father. The two embraced, and Henry breathed her name.

"There was once a man in the city who was very successful."
"Dad I'm going to be late," Helen said, knowing nothing could stop her father.
"The man was very successful, but was not happy."
"I get it dad."
"So he went to the forest, and there he trained to be an excellent teacher and priest and was famous in the country for his wisdom. He was happy for a while in the forest, but then the feeling faded. He returned to the city with new ideas for business and government, and was successful again, but again, after a while, was unhappy.”
The train platform suddenly hummed like a mosquito to signal it was time to depart.
“Dad —” Helen started. Henry waved her off with a finger and a look and continued.
“ — But, upon returning to the forest, he was again successful for a time as a teacher, but not for long."
"Then what happened?" Lily asked when her father paused. She had become mesmerized with the rest of the family by their father's parable.
"He decided to find a guru and ask him what was the matter,” Henry said. “The man explained what was the matter to the man. The guru said — "

"All aboard! Khrung-noi, Little India, New Sydney Station."

Helen went to the door of the train.
Henry followed her and touched his daughter's arm at the door of the train and turned her around.

"You have chicken poop in your pockets."
"Dad—!"
Henry turned sideways and winced slightly as the train door closed on him, gnawing him harmlessly.
"In the forest you have it, and in the city you have it. Take the chicken poop out of your pockets."
The door opened and closed again on him, like a confused robot.
"Take the chicken poop out of your pockets, and you will be happy," Henry said again to is daughter.
"OK. OK. Dad, I love you."
"I love you too—and don't get any tattoos or else—" Henry made a slicing motion across his throat with his thumb and a squirting noise with his mouth then extricated himself from the berserk doors of the train.





Helen sat down next to an Indian business man shouting into his Tooth and across from a gamer, zoning behind his glasses and fidgeting his right and left hands in game-play. She ignored the other passengers and delved into the internet. She had a lot of work to do and under an hour to get started. She turned on her "working hard" mix she had compiled of local NS artists. The goal: total self reinvention.

Hapsburo, a satellite town of 1.5 million, had never been big enough to contain her. And just as a chick in an egg knows when to start pecking in the dark, when she was sixteen she lashed out in the darkness of her own inexperience. Tatoo, older boy friend, heavy drinking, the works. In the dramatic and unscripted culmination of a reasonable 'three-strikes' policy, her mother had beaten her not once but five times with her hands. Three days later Helen drank the lion's share of a fifth of vodka.

Even with her stomach pumped, she had had to be resuscitated and she had slipped into a three day coma.  Her mother, a non-practicing Anglican, spent most of the time praying, taking care of the other girls, and giving offerings to some Thai monks in the neighborhood while Henry slept by her bedside looking as waxen as an old donut. When his eldest woke up, he just smiled through his wet eyes and hugged her to his pudgy, infinite chest.

Once she realized that there was an end to the tunnel of her life in Haspburo, that she could move, by herself, to New Sydney, the fog of her indescretions cleared and she became the helpful, kind, intelligent girl she once was—now with a nasty drinking habit. She had yearned for this trip, and planned for it, and worked to learn the skills she might need in her new life.

Before she could be confident, however, she had to nest into a new self. She had gone about like a sparrow picking up the twigs, leafs, bits of plastic, and even some christmas tinsle with which she could rebuild her nest. A photography habit there, an interest in cataclysmic history here, some flower cutting lessons and a speaking coach and she had the elements of her new self. Someday soon, she silently planned, she would not just be reading the posts of niche artists and traders on the web, she would make contacts with them, work in their worlds, and soon find her own contribution and her own life in the hive that was New Sydney.

She whipped open a document and typed. "I will be like water, hard when pushed hard, soft when pushed soft." She saved and closed the document never to look at it again.

The first step of reinvention was to tear everything down. She pulled down her profiles, disenabled usernames, avatars, and cleared her cashes and histories; she even unplugged her weblog. Deconstruction complete, she felt the most glorious and energizing feeling of freedom.





In the eye of the identity hurricane, Helen paused for a moment. At the speeds they were traveling, the train felt like it was flying, Helen imagined, but unlike the three dimensions and three axes in which an airplane can move, a train only has two dimensions for the shudders inherent to high velocities. Helen had never flown of course; any plane that didn’t run on negative-carbon biofuels were made illegal since the cataclysm making it impossible for normal people to fly.

The sun was setting in velvety orange and purple robes. Outside of the train, not an inch of the earth surrounding New Sydney had avoided investment. Furrows of earth were wrapped in celluloid plastic and irrigation channels wrapped around the mushroom cap roofs of subterranean suburban buildings.

As it got dark, she could see herself in the reflection of the train car window. Her black hair she had tried to lighten, with no success. She had followed the current fashion and kept her skin fair. She wore clothes that fit her and colors that made her smile. That explained the red and gold shoes she was wearing that came to a curly tip at the toe. Etta called them the "'ladin shoes." When Helen bought them, Lily just looked on in horror at her sister's fashion fearlessness.

Game-boy only needed a suction tube going to his mouth and a feeding tube down his nose and he would have been a vegetable. The indian business man had stopped shouting. Why was he shouting in the first place—the whole point of tooth implants was to make phone calls less obtrusive. As though in explanation, her father's pathetic but, nevertheless, energetic indian impression kept bubbling up in her mind and making her laugh.

"Look at how this man is turning glances in your very good direction," the voice said at first. "She is putting with it up oh so very well and even if he is having a poking hat, she is not seeing it," the voice nattered on. She mimed just a fraction of the exaggerated head bobble that accompanied every line of his act.

"I'm Shareef, what's your name?" The indian man suddenly said out of the blue, extending his hand toward her. Her micro head bobble must have had an unintended effect of warming him up to her.
"Helen, nice to meet you."
"You have taken this train before, I have seen you," he continued, his smile growing at one corner of his mouth.
"I've never been on it before in my life," Helen said. "Sorry." He deflated a bit and shut up. Helen went back to her reinvention.

She wanted it to be sleek, mysterious, approachable, and smart, like the pit of a succulent fruit. She searched for images of fruit pits and came up with a gamut of colors, effect of the light, ideas and concepts. The watermelon seed was the rabbit poop of pits. If she used it in her design, there would have to be countless of the little black digits, like the little footprints of gnomes or the pupils of puppies, going everywhere. The peach pit had a lot of magic in it. The peach pit contained the colors of a bruise, coffee, and the setting sun all in one amazing nugget. Its similarity to the bark of trees and the furrows of the brain overwhelmed Helen. How did a peach trea come out of that? Banana seeds— preposterous! Wheat—too provincial — she was moving to the big city by her self. Helen stopped at tomato seeds for a long second. They looked like frog's eggs, and surprisingly were not red like tomatos, but jaundiced yellow with an aura of green emanating from the 'tip' of the egg-shaped nucleus through their uterus of clear jelly. Pomegranates were a bit overdone. On the topic of Iberian fruit, however, Helen came across the virtual pit of pits.

She had only had a Cherimoya once in her life, at Christmas-time at her Aunt's house in Darwin. There had been 8 of the precious imported fruits to share among 20 family members and neighbors. Her father had foregone his share in order to watch Helen, his eldest daughter, spoon every last oily-sweet drop into her little mouth.

The Cherimoyas fruit has thin, light-green skin like a frog’s. Its surface is uniformly cratered with indentations like scales or fingernails that instead of denting out, dent into the fruit. Like the pomegranate, the white flesh of the Cherimoya wraps, in envelopes, around each of the 27 or so seeds. When ripe, the Cherimoyas' flesh is white and silky like the shavings of warm soap. When over ripe, the flesh is tope and mealy. Each seed is the size of the nail on a full grown man's pointer-finger, is as hard as a pican, and has the black velveteen texture of a seal.

Helen had found her logo.




"Arriving in Krung-noi, Thai thai thai thai, Chinese Chinese Chinese" said the overhead speaker in a female voice, starting in English, then Thai, then Chinese.

Helen looked out the window as the the train slowed and came to an imperceptible stop. With five minutes before the train left, she scrambled out of her seat to stretch her legs and take a walk in these exotic surroundings—maybe find something cheap to eat.

Both Hapsburo's station and Krung-noi's were made out of the same green glass arch, but the Thai had taken matters of decoration into their own hands completely. The platform was filled with hawkers selling food in stalls decorated with umbrellas, red-lettered signs in Thai, Chinese, and English, and all manner of little flickering lights powered from tiny solar panels on the roofs of the stands.

The smell of grilling, boiling, triturating, mixing, charring, drying, and fermenting food made Helen salavate. She snapped up some spicy looking pork on a stick with a healthy dose of what looked like an inedibly spicy sauce with some sort of green beans in it. One hawker was sitting down in front of a bowl of squirming white sea creatures that were the shape of crawdads and the size of crickets. He dumped a spoonful of seven or eight other sauces and fresh ingredients onto their heads and then pounded away with a wooden pestel to make a spicy, sweet, citrusy salad that people were queuing for. From a boy her age, she bought freshly peeled and sliced mango and watermelon, paying by hovering her phone over the universal purple "paypad" on the side of his cart, now sticky with flying fruit juices. From one smiling woman, Helen bought a bag of weird-looking savory nuts for later.

Hapsburo's station had nothing inside it but a coffee and print shop. In Krung-noi, an entire side of the station was filled to the roof with a golden sitting Buddha. 7 stories tall, sat cross-legged, his pupilless gaze looked down through eye slits that looked like a calligrapher's tilde. Although the eyes looked down, they peered at no single spot. Before him stacks of bright flowers were piled waist high. Trinkets, beads, and wooden bowls of oranges, pears, peaches, and dragon fruits covered large wooden tables by his sides. People were burning incense sticks that they held between pressed hands at their forhead in the Thai form of greeting and prayer Helen knew as a wai.




Helen settled back in her seat. The bustle had been exuberant, but now left her feeling detached and lonely. What if she had trouble making friends in her new life? Not just meeting people, that is easy, and in the last few months as her Hapsburo friends left, the more new people she met the fewer friends it felt like she had.
'Maybe if I meet no one new, she would have all the friends in the world.' she thought. 'Yeah right.'
Helen had always had a steady group of real friends, a crew of curmudgeons, a rotary of rubberneckers, a posse of peers, that made her listen, laugh, and learn. Many of her group of friends had moved to New Sydney or its suburbs, but following professional connections, they were all in different scenes and neighborhoods.

The train started moving. Helen got up to go to the dining car to get a coffee, finish eating the snacks she had bought, and meet some people going to New Sydney.

This is messy because there are things that just have nothing to do with anything, there are also very few characters (things need to EXPLODE in that department when she gets to NS.) I like the reinvention stuff, and her dad is funny. Needs wonky, cool girl stuff, faith-no-faith girl. Fear, strength, manipulation. Can do, can't do don't care. Wiz's Kid, Ibsen "the Goat" Montgomery, Godspower Wilfred.

Everyone else ranged from teen ipsocentric coolants with jacobin pants to a pair of what were obviously Wavelength mimes decked out in horse-hair top-hats and walking sticks.




Helen knocked on the door of the apartment once. Flakes of white paint chips from the walls littered the black, plaster- and paint-smattered ground.
The neighboring door creaked open. Helen glanced out of the corner of her eye and slowly turned her head. A man in white coveralls and buzzed grey hair looked out from between the door and the jam.
Helen jumped when her cousin's door opened and the neighbor's slammed simultaneously.
"Hey, cuz, how are you?"
"Dustin. I'm good" Helen said.
"Really how are you? I thought you weren't going to get here till later," her cousin said. Helen was still in the hallway.
Dustin was au natural, no piercings, no tattoos (illuminated or otherwise). He kept his hair in a shock of chestnut brown growing from his crown and shaved on the sides. His face was warm and illuminated, his nose turned up, and his fingernails on the door were impecable and fleshy half moons.
"Good. good. Can, uh . . . I come in?" Helen said.
"Sure, sure, of course."
Helen came in and threw down her pack.
A girl stepped out of the bathroom.
"Helen, this is Omega."
She had dark hair and pink lips, and she wore a lavender dress and ripped yellow stockings.
"Call me Alice."
"Whatever," Dustin said and jerked his head, and Omega's smile turned into a snear. She grabbed her clutch and slinked to the door in her flats. She turned on a dime at the door and blew Dustin a kiss, which he ignored. Omega, slammed the door.
Dustin lead Helen back to where her room was.
"The room is free. Tony (the guy who lived there before) left yesterday. We didn't have enough time to clean the room though."
The room was a catastrophe. Tony had been a smoker. The ashes, ash trays, burns, and stench gave it away. There were crusty socks, random pieces of electronics and wiring, a dried bowl of molding boiled noodles, and a mattress that looked like someone had died on it.
"He moved out yesterday?" Helen asked.
"Yeah. There is a dump." Dustin had moved to the window and was pointing down the thirty-four stories to the alley. "You can throw his shit from the window. We always do it."
Helen smiled weakly and her skin turned a light shade of green as fair people's often does.
They returned to the living room, and Helen sat down on the edge of a foam cushion of the couch. Unconsciously Helen held her jacket closed with one hand. Dustin could tell she was nervous, but Dustin had the funny trait of a very limited ability to interact with other people, especially with girls. He did not know how to be kind except during the process of coming onto a girl, he did what he might do when he has no chance of sleeping with a girl, but she is still in his house because of a crisis, danger, or bad weather.
"Can I get you a drink? Water? a beer?" Dustin asked
"Water I guess," Helen responded.
Dustin washed out a glass and handed it to his cousin full of water. The water tasted like copper and the glass smelt like orange juice and cigarette ash. Bile rose in Helen's throat, and tears came to her eyes.
They sat is silence for a bit, until it became too akward for Dustin.
"So, what are you planning to do for money? The rent is 140 Eights, that is about 87 New Syd's, you'll need to know that, most prices are posted in it around town. Patriotic city."
"I thought about writing for a newspaper," Helen said.
Dustin burst out laughing.
". . . eventually," Helen added.
"The newspaper? Well that is ambitious. Only the rich read the paper. Top writers can even get a letter to the editor, I guess, I mean—I don't read it, its 12 shells a paper, 24 on sundays— that's a week's salary for me. So, but, that is what I heard. Good luck." Dustin wagged his head side to side in disbelief.
"I'm very tired," Helen said.
"You can sleep on the couch if you like, for now." Dustin's phone beeped. "I'm going out."
Dustin got up, pulled out a cigarette and lit it up. He pulled a smile at Helen, his lips curling up with the smoke as he stalked out the door.
Helen felt the whole stress of her trip, the difficulty of having to forge a life in the filthy apartment with a roommate like her cousin—she kept herself from fully judging him. Because she had to stomach such difficulties, and because she felt in that moment the precise feeling of disjunction and pain of change, Helen's will crumbled, like a dam, or a levy, and she wept. She threw her face into the dry, black mold synthetic web of the couch. It was a terrible place to cry which made her tears hot and her throat sore.
When she had satisfied herself with weeping, and all those feelings had had their time, she sat up, wiped her face with the pad of her hand below her thumb, and began putting her new home in order. Helen started by throwing every last smidgen of Toni's "shit" out the 34th story window.




After weeks of the relentless newness of New Sydney Helen’s days fell into a routine that felt more or less comfortable. Children although their bodies are more pliant, flexible, and resilient, they themselves are actually worse at change than adults.
Most days, Helen awoke early and in the cool folds of the pre-dawn hours she would write at her narrow desk and drink two large mugs of cold peppermint tea. Her goal was always to write for Chidi, but as the internet’s shape suggested, with every click, her morning perambulations warped around a universe of the news, culture, technology, science, and history. By seven she might have queued up three or four posts for Chidi, and have stubs for another 3 and leads for maybe a dozen. As news is consumed more in the morning and evening, she found that her natural habit of getting up early made her blog very current, and commonly she would release three posts in the morning at 7:30, and then another set of two or three around 4:30.
After writing, she devoted the early part of the morning to operations and breakfast. It was impressive that Chidi was already making money, but some New Sydney bloggers were famous and made gobs of money, such as Gorgeous George –a fashion jet-setter—or Taylor Ricardo—the food critic—or Onono—the music reviewer. Researching her new cottage industry, Helen quickly found that there was really only two ways forward for Chidi—enhancements and affiliates. So Helen might nosh on some NS fruit or fry an egg while she went in search for better tools and more friends.
By hosting a blog, behavioral marketing algorithms already spewed ads at Helen about plugin services to improve her blog, target more readers, and make her more money. One recent offer had made it fashionable for posts to be stream of consciousness and largely in the present continuous—the service was tooth dictation which allowed bloggers anywhere and anytime to call their blog through their tooth and dictate a post. Another offer promised to double your readership by adding your blog to behaviorally enhanced affiliated marketing scams. Yet another allowed readers to tooth into your blog and have a voice (even your voice) read the blogs to them – interspersed with 10 second behaviorally targeted advertisements. Chidi did not have the cash flow to pursue these enhancements, but Helen kept a record of some of the offers she liked and thought might be useful.
Finding affiliates meant finding an ecosystem of media, personalities, products,and events that shared a family resemblance and were willing to coordinate their creative elements into a greater whole for each other’s mutual benefit. Writers instinctively dislike each other personally, nevertheless, they can work together anonymously and tolerate each other’s company when hearded together by financial circumstance. Helen had already linked out aggressively to blogs that she liked and thought bore some resemblance to hers. Besides written media sites, Helen read, viewed, and enjoyed the creations of artists, musicians, designers, and entrepreneurs looking for her tribe.  
Although Helen worked on Chidi day and night, it felt as though Helen’s involvement was only indirect, or even disconnected to the final form and tenor that Chidi adopted. One day, Helen posted a waxen, sepia image of an old goat chewing on some grass that grew out of the engine block of a wrecked gas-car. As though discovering that her child was an excellent dancer or a talented scientist, seeing that image on Chidi made her realize that Chidi was a site that was somewhat nostalgic and personal, but skirted sentimentally; instead, it had a flare for the iconoclast. Chidi wanted desparately to dig deaper, spelunk the caves of the shared imagination, illuminate the further regions—even risky regions—of Helen’s world and culture. She realized that Chidi might, like a ruthless editor, put even its own creator in danger in order to capture the stories that Chidi needed and would inevitably bring to light.







Her first morning in New Sydney, Helen awoke from fitful dreams into a foreign room. Just barely lit by the false dawn she could see the outline of the room—her new room. It had grey-purple walls, dreck in the corners, and stood totally empty except the narrow bed, an even narrower desk (and chair) by the window, and her big blue vynal trunk that stood upright, waist-high in the middle of the room.

Helen crept out of bed, went to the door, and turned to look over her shoulder out her window. In the brief glance she saw how the cool blue light reflected off the tops and sides of the New Sydney neighborhood and filtered through her cheap, kinked, and smoke-damaged aluminum blinds. The window, she noticed, was sizeable, even overly-large for the little closet-of-a-room, and the view, Helen thought, was charming.
She fetched cold water from the kitchen and washed her face and brushed her teeth. Instead of unpacking, or cleaning more, she pulled the clear glass panel of her second screen out of the side of her trunk, pulled open its kickstand, set it on the desk, sat down and then flashed on her device. The other screen recognized the signature and location of its comrade device and flashed milky white as it fired up as well.
She stalks the Thai guy.
Through her second screen she saw the sun rose on the horizion above the roofline horizon and flashed like a fat gold coin, like the ones that Thai-Chinese merchants are said to sew into their cloths and use only for important purchases, weddings, births, and funerals.
Helen’s stomach growled. She had not eaten last night or all morning. Below on the street many stories down, she heard the gentle bell ringing of the Thai fruit man in the street. A plan hatched in her mind—some fruit, some exploring, and a serendipitous visit to the Miller zone.






(butterfly of freckles across her face)
"Anne."
"And Lady Predator?"
"Its my blog."
"What is it about?"
"Art."
"What kind of music is that?"
"Some gargatuan bone-head thought that vin was in."
"Vintage?"
"Vinyl."
"I blog old people's stories."
"Vinyl is meant to be seen, not heard." Lady giggled and put her hands on either side of her deep and immaculate purple-blue curls with same. "I totally ran you over! But I had to say it." She flipped out a pad of paper and a pink pen with a sparkly fuzzball on top and giggled as she penned down the tagline. "You blog about old people's stories? Cute!"
Helen nodded and a corner of her black hair, the shape and color a raven's wing, fell in front of her eye. She couldn't believe this girl was real. But she was magnetic, spontaneous—and they were in the same business.
"My grandfather, he's Japanese. He could tell you good stories."
"Really?"
"He inspires me, so why not? Wanna go see Bu with me?"
"Bu who?"
"Don't cry!" Lady burst out in a laugh. "No, yeah, no, but, hey come on. Are you coming?"
“Wait. Your grandfather?”
“Bu? my grandfather?” Alice smirked.
"I better wait for my cousin,” Helen said.
"Your cousin is not as cool as Bu. Period." Lady grabbed Helen's hand and pulled her beside her and they marched off, Helen presumed, to find Bu.



Helen noticed how her friend behaved. She carried with her an innocent sexuality, covered provocatively in cotton, light weaves, and cut conservatively, but a seam ran over her chest gently following the curve, like water following two dips in the way, — like the eroticism of a child — it was present like a scent and unworked like raw wood.


Nic listens to LP's—long-playing record. Lady Predator.




“See the accents around his temples at the hair line?”  .. . . asked. Helen nodded. “Those have been added since the cataclysm. Water already was sacred for the Thais, but Bangkok going under, and then the chaos, like the movement of water, added a new tenant to the religion.”
“How do you know that?” Helen asked. . . . looked at her askance.
“I’m a sculptor and a Buddhist,” . . . said. Helen just nodded so interested in the statue that she didn’t notice how her question had hurt his feelings by putting his budding expertise in jeopardy. . . . redoubled his efforts.
“The face of the Buddha,” Helen said. “Its so calm — so penetrating.”
“Have you ever seen the face of Brahama?” . . . asked.
“No,” Helen answered.
“No? Not in little India?” . . . double checked. Helen had never been there. “The face of Brahama, the god of the universe, all life force — his face has wide pupilless eyes and full sensuous lips. It is an ecstatic face, a face whose senses and is looking outside of itself — beyond.”
Helen looked at . . . who kept his gaze on the Buddha.
“Did you know that the Buddha said make no images of me?” . . . said.
“Really?”
“That didn’t last. When the Buddhists wanted to convert Hindus, they made a statue like the statue of Brahama. But the face. The face they turned inside out.”
Helen looked back up the face of the Buddha. Sure enough, the eyes were slits and gently sloping a glance downward, as though looking inwards, not out at the world like Brahama’s. The lips were slim and understated, like the lines of calligraphy. The sensuousness turned into a fullness of an internal experience, rather than an ecstatic experience.
“Well,” Helen said, “did it work?”
“I don’t know the history or the statistics, I’m just a sculptor. Isn’t that your department?”


There was a temple near my home, a strage one — there weak minded people who could barely take care of themselves were chained to retards. We go through life like this, gaining shelter from those who excell beyond us, but who are close, those outside of our sphere. In equality.






"Blogging." Nic said with a grunt. "Willful self promotion. How vile."
"Say what you will—"
"I damn well will."
"You'll be dead soon anyways."
Nic cocked an eye up and his lips tightened imprecievably over his yellow horseteeth. Something faded in his face and he looked around. Helen thought that she had crossed a line, their banter was now over, and he would walk away.
Nic sharpened up.
"Dead or alive. That is how they want me. Anybody want you that way?"
"A few people want me alive."
"Your sweet little village family out in the ass-crack of the bush? Of course the want you alive, so you can send back money. Fifty years ago, course, wouldn't've been that way, but we've China-fied, the whole world China-fied. All Chang-Kai-Sheck's grandson you know. But me, they want me dead or alive."
"Anything to get you to shut up." Helen got up to get more hot water from the pot.
"Even you're China-fied. What is your background, Welsh? Irish? English? Maybe a spice of Cambodian about your eyes? A bit of Polpot in you. Murder. That is what it is, that is why you are so damn sincere, but so damn invidious. We all are. Polpot and Chang."
"But—" Helen began again
"China-fied." Nic grumbled.
Helen turned around holding a square white saucer upon which rested the big, forest-green bowl-mug.
"Anyways, my blog, which YOU asked about, so I am going to tell you—" Helen continued. Nic's grumble evanescing into a gentle hiss.
—"Nevermind."
They sat in silence. Nic looked pensive and his right knee had begun to knock against the other unconsciously, like his next har-umph was in his knee and was working itself up to his larynx to come out.
Helen blew on her tea.
Unconsciously, Nic felt the urge to draw this girl in. And he did think it was gross narcissism for her to going on about her blog.
"Let me tell you something then. I can tell you something important, about when I was your age, about how to survive in a city, make a bit of money, make something of yourself.
"What are you, 19, 20?"
"—"
"Nevermind, nevermind. My naivete touched the sky when I was 20. It was a different time, of course, before. And people were all the same and all different. A 20 year old couldn't do what they can today, they still had years ahead of them before they made anything of themselves. There were alot of 'employees' walking around. We called them 'tools'. They could only pound nails in someone else's house, dig someone else's ditch. And I, I was the brightest shiniest damned tool in the shed.”
"Example.”
"My first job was assistant to an account manager, named Ted Norton, ('Theodore') of Kern, an ad agency in San Diego. Ted looked like a giant baby, or larva, like the larva that lives in a paralyzed, living worm, enough to make Darwin an atheist. Strip him down and lather him up with baby oil, he'd be a big, baby maggot just waiting to be a huge, fat buzzing fly."
"That is disgusting."
"He was cunning, devious, a bona fide slob, and a pederast. He was Thai-Chinese. Elite. China-fication at its diabolical height. Now this is pre-catastrophe, pre-water-water-everywhere-not-a-pot-to-piss-in, pre-bullshit. His family was so rich they'd put golden rings on the toes of their fried chicken feet. Ted talked very quietly about his mother's still being alive.
"The world is full of these guys. He's cunning, cunning. His great grand-father had been a facist and through intrigue had usurped the King of Thailand's power during World War Two. Now his spawn caused me so much stress, I shat once a week.
"Ted would hold a meeting with a client, tell them 20,000 for the job, PR, print, the works, but no TV. The client would leave. He would call some tasteless bastards in Thailand like that—" He snapped. "and get the job done for 5,000.
"Then he had the nerve to tell me, with a straight face, that I was getting 200 bucks a week, or he would find someone else. Then he would chummy and friendly, tell dirty jokes to make you feel like you were slick."
"This is all very illuminating for a naive, helpless young girl like me, but didn't you have a story to tell." Helen knew that teasing him very harshly was the only way to prime the pump. Cantankerous old assholes, she was coming to find, required that kind of treatment.





each old man is a different flavor of asshole, cleft, constipated, bulldozer, stick-up, rotten. But they all have something to offer, if you can find it in your heart to be compassionate to them, and at the same time, goad and prod them the right way, takes a bit of attractive young girl, a bit of scorn, and an endless and honest attempt to grow in their presence.







I have to develop Helen's blog voice. and put her actual blog posts in as chapters.

Don't forget this is in AUSTRALIA!!!! So . . . Kangaroos, the bush, etc. sunsets, hot, . . . boat trip out to the sunken city, opera house, etc.

rain at some point. . .

When things get really bad, have banjo show up, scardi-cat




Eco terrorist leader guy with round hornrimmer tortous-shell glasses. "they work late--to six o'clock. . . "

Seem like badguys in the beginning.

Helen believes his conspiracy theories--and portrays them with compassion. Therefore earns some friends--they are hackers anx know pyrotechnics :-).




"They thought there was overpopulation, but that was a redherring to make ppl ignore the real problems. Currency devaluation in china especially, but everywhere really--and the intentional blocking of new technologies--did you know in the naughts a car was invented in los alamos labratories that could get 2,000 miles to the gallon of gas? Didn't read that in your history books. No overpopulation, the birth laws are just to divert people's attentions, to make them consternated and angry while the wool is pulled over their eyes."
