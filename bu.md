Bu looked out of the narrow window of his bathroom through the iron lattice of the fire escape. The dusk washed over Tokyo all from a side. Bu saw sparrows raking through the hot air streams in a web above the city of like the hooks of unseen anglers. It was as if the ancients were right and just as fish are oblivious of the world beyond the lips of their oceans, so to do we live in ignorance of those actors beyond our sphere.

Today Bu would meet Terrance, the Nigerian who ate only fruit. Bu had known about Terrance for months, before he stowed away in the bulk of an old post-cataclysm gasless cargo-clippers (one of the early design) to reach “Nippon”. Bu had evaded the brutal SRP who guarded Japan’s shores by hiding in a box full of frozen fish for over three hours as they combed the boat and scanned it looking for people who were not wanted. Now Bu moved with impunity only by dint of a fake workers permit he made with the help of one of New Sydnea’s top minters and counterfeiters, Marco.

Bu had lived in Japan half out of phase with the world, as all illegals do. Living on the fringe in Japan was somewhat easier for him because his mother was Thai, and that culture’s natural politeness and self-effacement lent him the super power of being virtually invisible even in a country as circumspect as Japan. He had little money, but was able to survive moonlighting at the tattoo shop of a gentle, naive man named Tatsu. He could not speak Japanese, but spoke very little anyways in any language. The only word he could pull off convincingly was the only word anyone really needs to say in Japan — sumimasen — “excuse me.”

He took the elevated rail in the pink-yellow light of the last of rays of sunlight. From above he weaved through the city. Tokyo is not like other cities with a center and a periphery. Instead, it is a conglomeration of over forty distinct neighborhoods, each a self-contained urban nucleus, each exhibiting its own proud harmony. As the train heaved to a start and stop again, everyone wavered like kelp, half the train almost sleeping on their return home from work.

Bu arrived at the address. The elevator door opened onto the 74th floor of the Sakura hotel in Shabuya. Down a short hallway lined with large flower arrangements stood an ornate blacklaquered wooden door with an orange trim. Beside it, protruding from the wall and hanging down to Bu’s knees height was a whitewoven nautical rope meant, Bu thought, as a kind of knocker.  

He pulled down on the rope. Nothing happened.

Then the door opened slightly and a tall, gaunt African man came out quietly and in a hurry. He looked Bu full in the face. The man stood a head and half taller than Bu. He had thick black, horn-rimmed glasses that were rectangular and oddly complimented his front row of pearly buck teeth. His skin was purple-black, like the shadows cast by furniture in moonlight, and his forehead was very prominent due to a receding hairline and his head was oddly haloed by a dome of black hair as dense and unmoving as rubber.

The man rushed past Bu, uttered a little “sumimasen” from rote, and after two enormous strides, jumped for the elevator button.

Bu looked at him for a second then turned back towards the closed door. Then turned around again.  


“Terrance?”

Bu had not seen any Africans or blacks in Tokyo yet during his stay, so who else could this tall man be?

The man looked over his shoulder at Bu, then back at the elevator door. He flung a noxious curse at the elevator in a language Bu had never heard. What happened next happened not in slow motion (as is it is often expressed) but in full consciousness.

Since time is the appreciation of change, in pivotal moments of history and one’s own life consciousness unfurls dramatically and one experiences many things that normally go unnoticed, thus it is that during car crashes, murders, violent crimes, as well as Olympic feats, battles, virtuoso performances, and the unveiling of monuments that details are remembered with strange vivacity, such as the make of a particular sort of grenade, or the particular shade of chartreuse in the skirt of an unknown woman, or the minute details of a meal like a thousand others you had consumed. Thus, with full consciousness, Bu appreciated the change that occurred around him in the next thirty seconds or so.

Terrance spun around flashing a large silver gun just as the blacklaquered door began to open again. Taking two quick strides up to Bu, Terrance put the cool mouth of the gun’s barrel against Bu’s temple. Terrance administered this ultra violent threat with a surprising gentleness that Bu would remember and, in a way, savor for the rest of his life. The gentleness was natural in the ancient and aesthetic sense; that is, Terrance’s whole life up to that moment prepared him to move deliberately and accidentally at once, just as an acorn deliberately becomes an oak tree directly where it fell by complete accident. Simultaneously, three Japanese emerged from the door and quickly arrayed themselves in battle formation.

Everyone was very silent.

The elevator door opened. Its bell dinged.

Terrance was gripping Bu’s arm tightly and slowly backed him towards the elevator. They got in, and Terrance reach up with his toe and pressed the button for the first floor. The doors closed.











Standing in Terrance’s presence, Bu felt physically tiny — a bug in comparison to this man. Why had he in Japan? Why had he sought out this dangerous and terrifying African? He was just some tattoo artist from New Syndey. Important? Famous? Ambitious?

Bu had risked a lot to enter Japan for his art. The country was an unerring and near autarkic nation, sealed as tightly as a vault. For the past three months he had reveled and explored the surging Japanese subculture of Irezumi — “under-skin-insertion” — which fifty years ago, before the cataclysm, had been limited to mere tattooing, but now spanned a gamut of body modifications from a standard commercial tooth implant phone, available all over the world, to the unique and recent Japanese development (and the purpose of Bu’s dangerous visit) — Bioluminecense.

Bu first got wind of the technology on the web back in New Sydney. The Japanese encrypted most of their web and slammed the connection shut with any whiff of a hack or a tor gate. Their precautions couldn’t stop the flow of data — nothing can do that — but it did mean you had to be looking for it, and Bu had been. At first he had read about glow in the dark tattoos, Bu was unimpressed and surfed onwards, but soon he read poems inspired by the Irezumi work of an artist named Hotaru — “Firefly”. The body art of Hotaru, the poems suggested, were as bright as candles, as flashing eyes, as the moon. These were not cheap glow in the dark toxic waste, these works were something else. The technology, he later read, was not chemical but nano-mechanical. Bu’s toes curled when he thought about it. Thousands of micro LEDs per centimeter of skin were powered by nano-scale machines that created a electric differential through the heat differential of the temperature of the body and the air. So long as the air was not exactly the temperature of the body, the wee machines powered their associated LEDs at a near 100% conversion of energy into light.

It was only made in Japan. Hotaru, Bu suspected, had invented and liscensed the technology with the Japanese patent office, the only artist who worked in it, and there was Terrance associated with Nigerian war lords and the Japanese Mafia — the yakuza — who exclusively owned and ran the state of Japan. Now, taken hostage by this man — the man he had wagered his life on a few times already who could make him one of the greatest tattoo artists in New Syndey. How much had he risked and sacrificed now to be slaughtered upon reaching the first floor by a thousand and one Buddhist yakuza samurai monks?

To ignore the gun pointed at him, Bu’s attention picked up the minutiae of dings in the walls, and grime between the vertical filigree of the elevator doors. The door started to bend in his imagination into a pattern he thought resembled the shoulders and back of a horse. As the mind often does, Bu’s made earnest plans that he would someday use the pattern in a tattoo. He never remembered this pattern again for the rest of his life.

Bu’s had no name in New Syndey, no grand success. What he had was orphaned ideas and half begun plans.







Terrance began the day with a strange ritual, part calisthenics, part inexplicable. Around five in the morning, he ran up and down the stairs of the apartment ten or fifteen times while running a hot shower. Then he spent twenty minutes in the bathroom and emerged fully dressed with his glasses fogged completely. Each day, after his shower, he would construct anew a small shrine of little things from around the house. He would use grains of rice or fruit or other food from the kitchen, bits of clothing, the rings from his fingers, or tattoo tools Bu had on hand. He was particularly pleased once when he figured out a way to use Bu’s long noodle cooking chop sticks to harvest bird feathers from abandoned and new nests just out of reach for the hand on the sill outside of the bathroom window. Next, placing his head towards the shrine, he would lie down, pull out his device, turned on some music, and would lay there for half an hour with a discarded shirt or scarf or leg of pants over his eyes to keep out the faint light of dawn just creeping in the apartment. Finally, he would clean up his shrine (usually into the garbage), and begin his day like a normal person by drinking tea and listening to the radio.

Unlike a normal person, Terrance lived up to his dietary reputation. As Bu had heard, Terrance let nothing past the barrier of his large white teeth that was not fruit. He would usually have five oranges for breakfast, along with two apples and a banana. Around midday he was at his most voracious and he would ask Bu to go shopping for him to get star fruit, papayas, mangos, melons, cherries anything he could lay his hands on.

One day Bu brought back artichokes; like all the other they were condemned to consumption by the African. Bu didn’t know if artichokes were fruit, but Terrance didn’t seem to mind. Another day Bu brought home cherry tomatoes. He hoped to provide Terrance something akin to a desert. Terrance didn’t even look at them. They spoiled on the kitchen table in the heat. Vegetables, Bu presumed. One evening, the entire contents of an acorn squash was consumed including the seeds in one sitting. Squash was allowed, Bu noticed. Bu took on the challenge of providing something nice for his friend and potential business partner.

One day, Bu stopped before the shrine of XXXXX and marveled at the folded paper decorations and the immortal brightness of the shrine’s orange gateway against the darkness of its silent forest. Beside the shrine, along the street, vendors sat on the ground selling the preparations for the Shinto holiday of Hanami — the festival of the “sakura” the cherry blossoms. On one old woman’s tarpuline blanket was a mound of what Bu soon learned were cherry buds — a delicacy eaten during this time of year in Japan.

Terrance looked at them, sniffed the opening of the bag, and smudged one delicate bud between the white pads of his long thumb and forefinger. Satisfied, he nibbled a bit on one, ate  a few more, and leaned back in exstacy.

“Where did you find this?” Terrance asked. Bu was silent, but his eyes glissned. Bu was happy to have succeeded in giving Terrance something he liked. “Only typhoons have this where I come from.”

The inexplicable comment didn’t sour Bu’s happiness and he decided to finally broach the subject they had weighed so heavily over the past five days that Terrance had made Bu’s hideout into his own.

Terrance was sitting on the small cloth chair reading messages on his device when Bu walked up to his side and decided to begin their business partnership.
“Hotaru--” Bu started abruptly and stopped choking on an admixture of fear and bashfulness.
“. . . what?”
“Do you know Hotaru?”
“What? What? I don’t hear you.” Terrance flicked his device off and looked at Bu with the stark attentiveness of his big eyes maginfied through his large glasses.
“Hotaru is an irezumi, like me, he makes tattoos.” Bu said. Terrance shook his head. Bu continued. “His tattoos are different though, they open.” Terrance sneared and looked confused and disgusted. Bu corrected his poor English — “They turn on. They are light.”
“Why?” Terrance said. “You want to meet him?”

Trade him meeting Hotaru and getting Terrrance a way to New Sydney. Deal





“You are a tortoise! A tortoise, Poo!”

Bu looked at his friend strangely.

“You are not a chicken,” Terrance said with approval.

To the Thai’s, the chicken was the buffoon animal on whom all the other animals (most notably the snake) would play tricks, so he was content that Terrance did not think of him as a chicken, but he did not know how closely Nigerian animism aligned with the brand he had known growing up.


















Fell angles with terrible cross-eyed faces filled the books of Bu. Inky sickles ran over scaffolding of grotesque musculature like the regal, slouching cadavers of Leonardo Da Vinci’s.

“Where were you the past 10 months?”

The gun’s hammer had been suspended above the pin for three and a half hours — the time Nelson had waited in Bu’s efficiency. Nelson had snooped around, tapped on walls, done some real police work, before getting one of Bu’s sketch books out to look over, pulling a piece of Bu’s ragged furniture so it faced the door, cocking his gun, and sitting down to wait.

Bu held up his hands, one of which held a hempen bag, and opened his Polynesian diamond eyes wide. Bu’s dense mass of nappy curls shook imperceptibly as he froze and with a false smile he tried to banish his embarrassment and fear at Nelson’s unexpected presence and gun.

Bu quickly did an inventory of his safety. His materials he kept nested away in his private workshop and using the Tor gateways, even Interpol could never have been tracked in his movements through the web. Nelson must be reverting to the old fashion way of doing things.

Nelson squeezed the trigger slowly, definitively.

“N — !” Bu flinched

“Just had to clear a chamber. You with me now?”

Bu was visibly shaking; his brown face yellow with nausea. Bu’s anger got up to a pitch. He ignored the gun, deciding he didn’t care if Nikolai used it, put down a large rectangular box gingerly on the floor, and rushed to his desk.

“Slow it down.”

“Do you want your money or not?” Bu fumed, powerless. He ratchet open the desk drawer, pulled out a wad of cash, and threw it into Nikolai’s lap.

“That is a lot of it. You get the rest in two weeks plus interest.”

“Its not that easy anymore.” Nikolai said.

Bu’s head sagged.

“What’s in the box?” Nikolai asked.

Nikolai had a head like a rudely fashioned sculpture of brown clay. The whole thing was covered in grizzled whiskers that he periodically had straight razored down to the skin. He wore the simple cotton and linen clothes of the tropics. Tattoos flashed from under his clothes at the wrists, ankle, and his loose collar.

“Biolux 4.0 — top of the line, three months ahead of the release date.”

Nikolai softened and the pistol’s tip quivered up. Bu continued.

“The fourth generation is compatible with my style so I signed up for training.”

“It must have cost you.” The gun levelled back at Bu. The question was pointed. But still owed Nikolai’s boss --Sri Nachbar — a small fortune upwards of twenty cold D’s.

“I went to Nairobi for the training, an outfit there got the machines and does training for about the third the price, my brother fronted the money,” Bu lied.

Nikolai shrugged. “So this is how you’ll pay Sri back?”

“And for you if you can buy me some time with Nachbar.”

Nikolai let the pistol fall and let the hammer down with the exactness of a professional.

“I will see what I can do. Send me the link. You have ten days.”

Bu’s elation shined through the deep physical agitation of having a gun trained on him for the last 5 minutes.

Although Nikolai was Bu’s waking nightmare, ever since meeting Bu for the first time two years ago, Nikolai felt like Bu was his apprentice or his step son. With the unique avuncular air of a mobster, Nikolai showed Bu respect and love through the difficulties he concocted for him. But Nikolai was not all cane. Nikolai often took, but he just as often gave largess.

Take the present circumstances — that very night Nikolai went out, made a few comments, and slipped Bu’s Tor link into a few discreet and wealthy hands who would appreciate being first in line to have their flesh interlaced with Bu’s craft and artistry. Although in Rome they put Art and Friendship on stuccoed walls in the forms of lavish and able Kings who direct the construction of cities. In reality these virtues eek out lives more akin to marooned sailors who in desperation must drink the brine of their local strand, and only with rough stones bludgeon their sustenance from the skulls of young coconuts.

Nikolai got up from Bu’s recliner, concealed the money and his gun under his clothes, and went out the door. With the door closed behind him, he lit a cigarette to smoke on the elevator ride down to the street.

Nikolai’s visit turned out to be a boon. His presence in the upper rungs of society, his discretion, and his credibility with body art and modification meant that he was ideal to market  Bu’s cottage industry. Given Nikolai’s usefulness to Bu it was easy to ignore Nikolai’s unique position as undercover Interpol intellectual property agent whose mission was to apprehend transgressors like Bu.

The next day the shop would be marketed and equipped for work — the first fourth gen Biolux shop in New Sydney. By nine AM, Bu would be booked for the next two months.

But that was tomorrow at 9.

Bu tapped a complex cocktail of downers and uppers into his bloodstream with his modified towni to calm him down and pick him up. He had no time to lose.

Sub-plot, bu's money, the detective, entwined with Helen, Sigmund and Michael Godfrie, WAMMIE!


Can see the lip piercing from the top like a stone that is just at the water's edge and the trough of every wave makes it visible and at every crest it disappears.



"But that was after the diaspora, what about trade before?" Helen's voice was confident because she had studied this. For a project she did at a charter when she was fifteen. The goal was to plan the production of apples at a profit over 10 years with changing prices and outputs. Helen had been responsible for the logistics, and as part of her project, she had run across a cashe of books about shipping before the cataclysm as well as after. Her explorations into the topic made her a real specialist on the world economy pre 2021.

"Trade was conducted in and out of the nations, and commerce was conducted and accounts tabulated in national moneys, the five most prevalent of which where the Chinese Yuan, the US Dollar, the Euro, and the Brazilian Real. At the beginning of last century the only money people used was gold, and bank notes redeemable in gold, but as the nation grew more powerful and industrialization went into full swing, national banks were able to hold the majority of gold and their bank notes saturated the market. Then, the national legislatures illegalized all other bank notes but their own."
Helen had only learned about the movement of goods over the oceans, but she had never heard even a breath of this story about money.
"But how did we get from that to now? The Cataclysm?"
"If you want to hang a sign on it, yes the Cataclysm. Of course the real history is a series of minuscule coincidences and choices of individual people. Have you ever read War and Peace?"
Helen shook her head. Having avoided academic charters she had never heard the title and was more excited than ever to read it.
"Put Tolstoy on your list if you ever want to understand history."
"A series of choices and coincidences for people like Michael and Sigmund Godfrie?"

Helen mentioned the name because she knew it—everyone knew it. Michael Godfrie was one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the post-cataclysmic world, and the virtual king of New Sydney. His bank Godfrie & Godfrie had been the first institution to be reborn from the ashes of the cataclysm. They had financed roads and basic services and through their ability to finance had partially owned most companies and the city government. After the worst was over, Godfrie & Godfrie's business incubation team turned New Sydney into a hub of innovation. Like benevolent kings, the Godfries had always allowed other people to compete with them and even use the secret of their success—they were a bank that produced its own money.

Uncle Nic shrugged his wirey shoulders and raised his owl-like eyebrows and nodded with a sigh. "Godfrie did make some important decisions, and experienced his fair share of coincidences. He started his bank before the Cataclysm and was hounded by national authorities, the press, whole books were produced just to declaim his 'experiment'. Some thought it was a return to Nazism."
"But it worked. I think he did the right thing."
Uncle Nic smiled his yellow smile, "You and everyone else in our generation--we enjoy the benefits of money that is as free as the wind, but that was not the way his contemporaries saw it. What is now common practice, 136 domestic moneys in New Sydney alone, would have seemed insane to a nationalist. Even today's nationalists want just one money per city."
"No, no, I understand how they saw it, and I would have supported him anyways. Really, 136 moneys?"
"Okay, okay, so you're a revolutionary." Uncle Nic cocked his head at her and his eye twinkled. Helen smiled mischiviously.
"That is right," She said.
They bumped fists.


"People with nothing only have their labor to exchange—"
"—and their good name," Helen interrupted. "Although you don't really exchange that—you lease it."

Academics debate whether there was 'hyper-inflation' but prices jumped about 200% in a week, so call it what you will, lots of people were stocking up with gold, silver, diamonds, canned foods, and of course guns. Anyways that got rid of the 'launch problem' of a money that wasn't national. Starting a business in this panic would have been insane, but that is what the Godfrie's did.  


Gets started blogging, making money with behavioral targeting directing traffic to her and putting good ads on her Cherimoyas site--gets interested in a story about (like a pelican brief) business, politics, a law or something, pre-post cataclysm, the path gets her involved in a bunch of people, on her second blog post, she gets some recognition, some money, success, starts sleeping with Som Chai. Tapped by Godfrie, threatened, he seems like a bad guy, but is actually protecting her from his brother, Sigmund, who has more to loose, b/c he was their liason with global banking elites the Morgans, Rockefellers, and Carnegies, City bank, Chinese banks were there enemies, but they were making headway around the time of the cataclysm to found a global bank, and global money. Sigmund was not totally against it.
She keeps publishing, along Nic's advice. Nic dies of seemingly natural causes.
Publishes more.
Attack on her life, Som Chai saves her, bashing his most beautiful statue apart in the process.


Does oral history


set up characters that will be enemies, keep secrets from each other, get revenge, fight, fall in love with each other, then hold onto that for a bit, then let them have it! All cascading with a central conflict that is resolved through the cascade of character reactions.


Character ideas:

Woman with white hands stained with pigment like paint. She had a nasally voice and used endearing terms like "mandy' to talk to Amanda


Hirsuit man with fat fish-lips and a voice that, even though he spoke at a normal pace, sounded like it was deapened and slowed down digitally



“Its a hundred and sixty years too late to be writing in cafes,” the man said wickedly trying to provoke her. He had a big drooping nose that looked like it was made out of ceiling puddy, a frowsy herringbone coat, and the jocular red scarf like Aristide Bruant.

Helen glanced over at him and said sarcastically — “What else can you remember about the old days?”




Chapter ideas:

Next chapter—landlord in the same building as her cousin Dustin--an asshole, natural PUA, who will be no help at all, Thinks about som chai, goes to a cafe, people watches, strikes up a conversation w. lovable random old man, Joseph, pays for something, begins her blog as an oral history blog.

Next Chapter—finds that over 600 people read her blog and 15 people commented. She made 25 bucks! Goes back to find Joseph. Meets Nic. More than she bargained for. Blogs their talks.

Goes on a date with a looser, makes all the mistakes possible, he's totally in love with her, her inner can't respect him,

Breaks a story about history.

Gets burned about the conspiracy nuts. Meets more of them, is mixed up, believes them, posts st. stupid. readership increases but then decreases.

Move into an office space.

Nic tells her the story of the psychologist. Goes to see somchai's art, which makes her realize that conspiracy people are just making art unconsciously. Som Chai asks her out.

Breaks a story about price history, productive vs. consumption goods, the market was prefiguring a single money. Shows that Sigmund was trying to create a world currency during the crisis.

Nic doesn't blog, he's a FedEx man, bit of a crocodile hunter. He's the messenger.

Comes up with her own money that hasn't been done.

Godfrie uses this as a pretense to pick her up, not sure what is going on, she's won a contest or something.

Some notes:

Cheapness => transformation without sacrifice

Great characters —
	binarity vs complexity — the binary man can be more active, the complex man becomes  a commentator. A complex man that is active must make sacrifices like the Roman Philosopher Emperor. Unless he can find a point of leverage and heave.

the paradox of action and being attached to the fruits of actions. The paradox of action, and its resolution by becoming detached from the fruits, by removing the compounding of suffering and having an unmediated experience of reality.

that paradox is best created through a tragic paradox — The BG just has it through saying there was a civil war on and Arjuna could not act. Hamlet, his father. Achillies, Agamemnon.

Moby dick, Ishmael the character who is a complex person and a commentator watches the expression of his opposite in Ahab. Hamlet watched himself in a fantasy becoming that person. Homer watched Achilleus and Odysseus. Poetry became action in BG. Pure human feeling, refacting like a jewel box or an Faberge egg is Tolstoy’s war and peace.

The truth of a conspiracy, its falseness.

To live the truth, or be silenced. To have an indomitable will in the face of adversity.
